1. Create a Rectangle class
Create a Rectangle class with length and breadth as instance variables.
Write a default constructor that assigns both values to 5.
Add a method area() to calculate and display the area of the rectangle.
Explanation: This practice teaches how to initialize instance variables using the default constructor and perform a calculation.
2. Create a Circle class
Create a Circle class with a radius field.
Use a default constructor to set the radius to 10.
Add a method calculateCircumference() to calculate and display the circumference using the formula 2 * Ï€ * radius.
Explanation: This question reinforces object-oriented principles and demonstrates mathematical operations with classes.
3. Create a BankAccount class
Create a BankAccount class with fields accountNumber and balance.
The default constructor should assign a fixed account number and balance.
Add a method deposit() that increases the balance by a fixed amount, e.g., 100.
Explanation: This teaches object initialization and the concept of modifying instance variables through methods.
