Refer following diagram

 
Classes and methods description given below
class User
{
  private int id;
  private String name;
  private String  email;
  private String contact;
  private String userType;
 //write here setter and getter methods 
  public User(){
  }
  public User(int id,String name,String email,String contact,String userType)
  {
  }
}
class Student extends User
{  String deptName;
   String year;
//write here setter and getter for deptName and year

   public Student()
   {
   }
   public Student(String deptName,String year)
   {
   }
   Book book[];
    
   void setBooks(Book ...book) 
   Book [] getBooks():     
    
}
class Librarian extends User
{
     private String designation:
  //write here setter and getter method for designation

}

class ValidateUser
{
   public int validateUser(User user)
   {
      // check the user login 
   }
}

Note: we consider email of student as username and contact of user as password so you can check
user login using email and contact 
Book.java
___________________________________________________
class Book
{ 
   private int id;
   private String name;
   private String author;
   private String subject;
   private String isbn;
   private Boolean status;
   public Book(){
    }
   public Book(int id,String name,String author,String subject,String isbn,booean status)
   {
   }
 //write setter and getters for book
}

LibrarianRepository.java : this class help us to write logic for librarian activity means after librarian login
developers can write all librarian logics in this class.

void addBooks(Book []b): this method can accept array of object as parameter and store data for next process
and book should not be added in array of objects repeatedly and set status of every book as false when added by librarian
void addStudents(Student s[]): this method can accept student objects and store them in an array of objects for next uses or process.
Book [] getBooks(): this method can return all books in detail.
Student [] getStudents(): this method can return all student list to librarian
Student[] getStudentName(String name): this method can return student list by name
Book getBook(String bookName): this method can return book detail by name
Book[] getIssuedBooks(): this method can return only issued books
Student [] getStudentWithIssedBook(): this method can return a student list with issued books.
int getTotalBookCount(): this method can return total book count which is present in library
int getIssuedBookCount(): this method can return total issued books count
int getAvailableBookCount():this method can return total available book which we can issue
 

StudentRepository.java: this class  help us to write logic for student activity means after student login
developers can write all student logics in this class.

class StudentRepository
{  Book book[];
  
 void viewBooks(): this method show the books to students which is not issued 
 Book issueBook(String name,int id): this method can accept book name and id and issued book means change status as true when book issued
 Student getProfile(String email,String contact): this method accept email and contact and return student profile.
 void editProfile(): student can change own profile 
 void viewSelfIsseBooks(): this method can show the self issued book list to student 
  int getTotalBookCount(): this method can return total book count which is present in library
  int getIssuedBookCount(): this method can return total issued books count
  int getAvailableBookCount():this method can return total available book which we can issue
  void returnBookToLibrary(Book b): this method can return book to library means change the     status of book as true.
}
