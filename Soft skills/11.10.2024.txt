Step 3 - It was a story of an old man living in a village. Those days, the whole village was facing a huge problem. Strange labyrinths were appearing out of the ground, like something from a magical fairy tale. Every day, the mazes grew larger, and no one knew why they were there or what they meant. The oldest villagers spoke of an ancient curse that could only be broken by finding the heart of the maze.

One of the villagers, an old man named Elder Kishor Kumar, had lived in the village for many years. He loved telling stories to the children about heroes who had faced great challenges. Kishor believed that words and stories held great power, and he was sure there was a way to save the village.

One evening, as the sun set, Kishor gathered some brave villagers at the entrance of the largest maze, near the Lady’s Grove, a special forest. “We must go inside and find the answer,” he said. “Only then can we save our home.”

With the bravery of a strong horse, Kishor and his friends stepped into the maze. The walls seemed to whisper, and shadows moved around them, making strange shapes. They knew the maze was testing them, and they had to stay strong and work together.

As Kishor and the villagers made their way through the maze, they faced challenges that tested their courage and wisdom. Strange creatures tried to scare them, but Kishor reminded everyone to stay calm and stick together. With each step, the maze grew quieter, as if listening to their determination.

Finally, they reached the heart of the maze, a glowing stone surrounded by swirling light. Kishor stepped forward and spoke a simple, powerful word: "Hope." The stone’s light grew brighter, and the ground began to tremble. In a flash, the maze disappeared, and the village was safe once again.

The villagers cheered and thanked Kishor for his bravery. From that day on, they remembered the power of unity and hope, and Kishor’s stories became even more cherished.
