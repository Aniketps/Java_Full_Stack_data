Past memory of mine:

When i was 14 y/o i had a bicycle. That was my favorite one. Those were the days when i got my bicycle, During those days i did everything to learn how to ride on it, From many mistakes of mine i tried to ride on it but i felled every single time till a week, After a week passed, i had all control over my bicycle. I had traveled long ways from one village to another on it, travelling across rivers and forests. When i got a bicycle just because of me my friend were forced or i can say requested to their parents to have one. We all friends had a big friend circle around 8 to 10 friends in it. we all were from same village, After school we all plan to go river side and catch fish. We had four Bicycles in group. In 2019 when i was in 10th grade, Bicycle of mine had taken away from me just because i was moving to city for higher studies.
