	<p style="font-size: 20px" ><i><b>Technically</b>, <u>Luffy</u>'s last name is <u>Monkey.</u> <br> Y'know, Japanese name orders and all that. <br/>Smartass remarks aside, Luffy's family name is just <u>Monkey.</u> <br> The <u>D</u> is a middle initial, and it's not reserved for just the Monkey family</i></p>
	
	<p style="font-size: 20px" ><i>Luffy's superpower is his ability to stretch his <u>limbs</u> â€” and we're not talking about yoga. <br>Made of <u>rubber</u>, his arms and legs give him an advantage in any fight. <br>Whether he's kicking through brick buildings or propelling himself into his opponents like<br> a slingshot, you don't want to be on his bad side.</i></p>

	<p> <i> Luffy first met Shanks in his hometown of Foosha Village when he was seven years old. <br>The two get on extremely well and have equal intrigue and admiration for one another.<br> They both made a promise to each other that they would meet again once Luffy<br> has formed a crew and become a great pirate that has surpassed Shanks. </i> </p>

	<p> <i> Fans know Dragon to be a character capable of manipulating the weather. <br>He can create strong gusts of wind, and rain, bring cumulonimbus, summon lightning, and<br> do just about anything that one can imagine. <br>These powers are not natural for a Devil Fruit user to showcase. </i></p>

	<p> <i> Zoro is a former bounty hunter and the first recruited member of Luffy's crew, the<br> Straw Hat Pirates. While it's not explicitly stated, both One Piece fans<br> and characters alike consider him the crew's vice-captain. <br>The name Roronoa Zoro comes from Francois l'Olonnais, a real-life French pirate in the 16th century </i></p>
