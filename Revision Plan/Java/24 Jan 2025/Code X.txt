1. Create a Rectangle class
Create a Rectangle class with length and breadth as instance variables.
Write a default constructor that assigns both values to 5.
Add a method area() to calculate and display the area of the rectangle.
Explanation: This practice teaches how to initialize instance variables using the default constructor and perform a calculation.

2. Create a Circle class
Create a Circle class with a radius field.
Use a default constructor to set the radius to 10.
Add a method calculateCircumference() to calculate and display the circumference using the formula 2 * Ï€ * radius.
Explanation: This question reinforces object-oriented principles and demonstrates mathematical operations with classes.

3. Create a Student class with attributes name, rollNumber, and marks. Use a constructor to initialize the values and write a method to display whether the student has passed (marks > 40).
Explanation: This problem will help you implement logic within a constructor and a method based on conditions.

4. Create a Employee class with fields empId, empName, and salary. Write a parameterized constructor to initialize these fields and a method to display the details along with a salary increase if applicable.
Explanation: Focuses on using constructors to set employee attributes and implementing logic to apply conditions on salary.
