1. Matrix Multiplication
Write a program to multiply two matrices. The program should take two matrices as input and return
their product if the multiplication is possible (i.e., the number of columns of the first matrix equals the
number of rows of the second matrix).
Input:
● Matrix A with dimensions m x n
● Matrix B with dimensions n x p
Output:
● A matrix of size m x p representing the product of A and B.
Example:
Matrix A:
1 2 3
4 5 6
Matrix B:
7 8
9 10
11 12
Output:
58 64
139 154


2. Spiral Order Traversal
Write a program that prints the elements of a 2D matrix in a spiral order, starting from the top-left
corner.
Input:
● A 2D matrix of any size m x n
Output:
● The elements of the matrix printed in a spiral order.
Example:
Input Matrix:
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
Output:
1 2 3 6 9 8 7 4 5


3. Find the Largest Sum of a Submatrix
Write a program to find the largest sum of any submatrix in a given 2D array.
Input:
● A matrix of integers.
Output:
● The maximum sum of a submatrix that can be obtained from the given matrix.
Example:
Input Matrix:
1 2 -1 -4 -20
-8 -3 4 2 1
3 8 10 1 3
-4 -1 1 7 -6
Output:
29 (The maximum sum is for the submatrix from (1, 1) to (2, 4))
