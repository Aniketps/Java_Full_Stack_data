1. Understanding <div> and <span>:
Create a simple webpage where you use:
A <div> to create a container with a background color and padding for a section of text.
A <span> to style specific words within the text, such as making them bold or changing their color.

2. Implementing Semantic HTML:
Design a basic webpage for a blog post using the following semantic HTML elements:
<header>: Add a title and navigation links.
<article>: Include a blog post with a heading and paragraph.
<section>: Add a subsection for related articles or comments.
<footer>: Add a copyright notice and contact information.
