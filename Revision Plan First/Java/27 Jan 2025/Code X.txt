1. Create a Car class
Create a Car class with fields speed and fuel.
The default constructor should initialize speed to 60 and fuel to 50.
Add a method drive() to simulate fuel reduction by 10 units per drive, and display the updated fuel level.
Explanation: Simulates state changes in objects through method logic.
2. Create a LightBulb class
Create a LightBulb class with a field state (boolean).
Use the default constructor to set the bulb to off (false).
Add methods turnOn() and turnOff() to toggle the state and display the current state.
   Explanation: Covers state management in an object and logic toggling.
3. Electricity Bill Calculation
Create a Customer class with fields customerName, customerID, and unitsConsumed. Add a method to calculate the bill amount based on units consumed (slab rates).
Explanation: Implement a tiered billing system with logic for each slab.
4. Car Mileage Calculator
Create a Car class with fields make, model, milesDriven, and fuelUsed. Add a method to calculate mileage (milesDriven / fuelUsed).
Explanation: Ensure proper handling of edge cases like zero fuel.
