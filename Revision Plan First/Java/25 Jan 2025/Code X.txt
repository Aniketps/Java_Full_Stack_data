1. Create a BankAccount class
Create a BankAccount class with fields accountNumber and balance.
The default constructor should assign a fixed account number and balance.
Add a method deposit() that increases the balance by a fixed amount, e.g., 100.
Explanation: This teaches object initialization and the concept of modifying instance variables through methods.

2. Create a Student class
Create a Student class with fields rollNo and marks.
Use the default constructor to assign a default roll number (1) and marks (75).
Add a method displayDetails() to print the student details.
Explanation: This ensures a strong grasp of constructors and how instance variables can hold unique values per object.

3. Prime Number Checker
Create a Number class with a field num. Use a parameterized constructor to initialize it. Add a method to check if the number is prime.
Explanation: Use efficient prime-checking logic with a clear object-based implementation.


4. Library Management
Create a Library class to store the name and numberOfBooks of a library. Add a method to issue a book (reduce the count by 1) and another to return a book (increase the count by 1).
Explanation: Focus on managing the count correctly through method calls and validate against negative counts.
